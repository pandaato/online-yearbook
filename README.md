**UCDavis Class of 2020 Yearbook**
===================================
By Peter Lin, Grace Sun, and Aaron Pan
--------------------------------------

If you are a UCD class of 2020 graduate who wants to be acknowledged or a person who wants to see
who graduated UCD in 2020, you've come to the right place.

Navigation through the website is as follows:

Home/Splash Page
----------------
You start out on this page. There's a section on the left (top if you're on mobile) where you can log in
with Google if you want to upload your own profile. Note that you have to log in with a UCD email. 
If you don't, you'll be redirected back to the splash page and the "login with UCD email" will become 
red because you didn't follow directions :( If your login was successful, you'll be redirected to the creator page.

The section on the right (bottom if you're on mobile) has a button that'll take you to the entire yearbook
if you want to see everyone, as well as a search bar. On that search bar, you can search firstname + lastname or
just firstname. You can't search by *just* lastname. If you want a more refined search, hitting "Advanced Search" below will reveal a 
bunch more options. Typing in the Major and Minor fields of Advanced Search will reveal an autocomplete of the majors and minors available.
Click the Search button (it's a magnifying glass) to execute the search.

**Note that in the chrome developer tools' mobile view, the advanced search dropdown for College is cut off,
but this is not the case when using an actual iPhone.**

Creator Page
------------
This page is where you create your profile entry in the yearbook after you've logged in. 
You don't *have* to upload a pic of yourself, but if you don't upload a picture, you'll have a basic, 'blank' profile pic 
displayed in your face's stead. Only the Minor and Talk About Yourself fields are optional. 
*Click the Display button at the bottom to upload your profile.* You'll be redirected to the View Page, which
is where you view your specific profile.

**Note that you cannot edit your profile once you've uploaded it. You can only upload another entry.**

At the bottom, in addition to the Display button, there is also a Home button and a Yearbook button. The Home button takes
you to the Home/Splash page, and the Yearbook button takes you to the Yearbook page, where you view the entire yearbook.
**All buttons log you out.**

The accompanying jsx file for this page is called "Information.jsx". 

Yearbook Page
-------------
This page is where you see the whole yearbook. Click on a person's card to be redirected to their Display page showing all
their info. At the very bottom, there is a Home button that'll take you back home, and a search bar and advanced search settings 
that act like how they do in the Home page.

Display Page
------------
This page is where you view a specific person/entry's data. Everything they uploaded is shown. You get here either by
clicking on the Display button after uploading a yearbook entry from the creator page, or by clicking a person's card
in the Yearbook Page.

At the bottom, the Home button will take you home and the Yearbook button will take you to the yearbook.
